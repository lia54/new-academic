As a graduate student in Computer Science at the [Systems Research Laboratory](http://sylab-srv.cs.fiu.edu/) (Sylab) under the supervision of [Prof. Raju Rangaswami](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~raju/WWW/), I have been exploring the fascinating realms of storage systems, distributed systems, operating systems, and the intersection between systems and machine learning. In my previous research projects, I successfully designed and implemented novel caching algorithms for storage caches, leading to a significant improvement in performance. I have also been actively involved in the development and enhancement of distributed systems solutions for today's cloud data centers.

Prior to my Ph.D. program at FIU, I had the privilege of gaining valuable industry experience. I was a research intern at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK, where I contributed to the Project Silica project. In 2021, I further honed my skills as a research intern at Seagate Technology. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of the field but have also provided me with practical insights that I can apply to my current research. Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I completed my bachelor's degree in telecommunications and electronics engineering in Havana, Cuba.
