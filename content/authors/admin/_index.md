As a Ph.D. student in Computer Science (CS) at the [Systems Research Laboratory (SyLab)](http://sylab-srv.cs.fiu.edu/) under the supervision of [Professor Raju Rangaswami](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~raju/WWW/), I have been exploring the fascinating realms of storage systems, distributed systems, operating systems (OS) and the intersection between systems and ML. In my previous research projects, I successfully led a team focused on designing and implementing novel caching algorithms for storage caches, significantly improving performance. I have also actively developed and enhanced distributed systems solutions for todayâ€™s cloud data centers (DC).

Before graduating from my Ph.D. program at Florida International University (FIU), I gained valuable industry experience. I was a research intern at Microsoft Research (MSR) Cambridge, UK, where I contributed to the Project Silica. In 2021, I further honed my skills as an intern at Seagate Technology. These experiences have enriched my understanding of the field and provided me with practical insights to apply to my current research. Before starting my Ph.D., I completed the BSc in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering in Havana, Cuba.
