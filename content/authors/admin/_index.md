As a newly graduated **Ph.D. student in Computer Science (CS)** at the [Systems Research Laboratory (Sylab)](http://sylab-srv.cs.fiu.edu/) under the supervision of [Prof. Raju Rangaswami](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~raju/WWW/), I have been exploring the fascinating realms of storage systems, distributed systems, operating systems (OS), and the intersection between systems and ML. In my previous research projects, I successfully led a team focused on designing and implementing novel caching algorithms for storage caches, leading to a significant improvement in performance. I have also been actively involved in the development and enhancement of distributed systems solutions for todayâ€™s **cloud data centers (DC)**. 

Prior to my Ph.D. program at Florida International University (FIU), I had the privilege of gaining valuable industry experience. I was a research intern at **Microsoft Research (MSR)** Cambridge, UK, where I contributed to the **Project Silica**. In 2021, I further honed my skills as a research intern at **Seagate Technology**. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of the field, but have also provided me with practical insights that I can apply to my current research. Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I completed the **BSc in Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering** in Havana, Cuba.
